## Summary

Latent Diagnostics research complete. Clear findings on what the method can and cannot detect.

## Key Results

| Detection Task | Effect Size | Works? |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| Task type (grammar vs reasoning) | d=3.2 | Yes |
| Computational complexity | d=2.4 | Yes |
| Adversarial/anomalous inputs | d=1.2 | Yes |
| **Truthfulness** | d=0.05 | **No** |

## Core Insight

**Activation topology measures HOW a model computes, not WHETHER it's correct.**

- Simple tasks (grammar) → focused, high-influence computation
- Complex tasks (reasoning) → diffuse, low-influence computation
- True vs false statements → identical topology (no signal)

## Robust Metrics

Use these:
- `mean_influence` — causal strength (d=3.2)
- `concentration` — focused vs diffuse (d=2.4)
- `mean_activation` — signal strength (d=1.7)

Don't use:
- `n_active` — confounded by length (r=0.98)
- `n_edges` — confounded by length (r=0.96)

## Use Cases

**Works for:**
- Input classification (what type of task?)
- Anomaly detection (is input unusual?)
- Complexity estimation (how hard is model working?)

**Doesn't work for:**
- Hallucination detection
- Fact-checking
- Output quality assessment

## Data Computed

- `domain_attribution_metrics.json` — 210 samples, 5 task types
- `truthfulness_metrics_clean.json` — 200 samples, TruthfulQA
- `pint_attribution_metrics.json` — 136 samples, injection benchmark

## Figures

All in `figures/domain_analysis/`:
- fig1_domain_radar.png — Radar chart of 5 domains
- fig2_influence_concentration.png — Scatter showing clustering
- fig3_influence_gradient.png — Bar chart focused→diffuse
- fig4_length_control.png — Proves influence independent of length
- fig5_effect_sizes.png — Cohen's d for all metrics

## Infrastructure

- Parallel Modal runner (8 A100s, ~8x speedup)
- Incremental saves (crash-safe)
- Resume from partial completion

## Files to Read

- `MISSION.md` — Full thesis and findings
- `README.md` — Public-facing summary
- `experiments/domain_figures.py` — Figure generation

## Next Steps

1. Write paper draft
2. Consider additional experiments (if needed)
3. Decide on publication venue

## Continuation Prompt

> Research project complete. Activation topology measures computation TYPE not correctness. Strong signal for task classification (d=3.2), no signal for truthfulness (d=0.05). Read MISSION.md for full context. Ready to write paper.
